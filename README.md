# EthicalBruteforce
Lowkey buggy but simple brute-force tool. 
I've been taking a break from coding and whatnot and thought this would be cool. I wanna get into cybersecurity and ethical hacking more.
Tried Python for the first time after years!
.. I've had some troubles making this, getting tons of errors. I suck at py and git LOL
